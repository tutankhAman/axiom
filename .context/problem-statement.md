Eco-Loop Building Agents

Problem Background
Buildings consume approximately 40% of global energy and remain a primary driver of carbon emissions. Traditional Building Management Systems (BMS) rely on rigid, rule-based schedules that fail to adapt dynamically to real-time changes in weather, occupancy, and grid demands. The integration of AI offers a paradigm shift. By pairing physics-based energy simulation engines with open-source LLMs and standardized communication protocols - like the Model Context Protocol - we can create truly autonomous structures. This approach transforms a building from a passive energy consumer into an active, self-correcting agent capable of continuous, real-time optimization.

Technical Core Requirements
1. The Simulation Engine (EnergyPlus)

    Utilize EnergyPlus to run high-fidelity building energy simulations.

    You may use functional libraries (e.g., eppy, PyEnergyPlus, or EMS/BCVTB) to bridge Python or execution runtimes with the underlying Input Data File (.idf) or Functional Mock-up Units (.fmu).

2. The Cognitive Engine & Protocol (OSS LLM & MCP)

    Deploy any modern Open-Source LLM (e.g., Llama 3, Mistral, Qwen) running locally or via a self-hosted API.

    Implement an MCP Server or custom agentic tools. The LLM must use these tools to parse files, extract runtime errors, and execute tasks without human code modification.

3. Closed-Loop Execution Framework

    Feedback (EnergyPlus -> AI): The simulation must stream continuous performance metrics (e.g., zone temperatures, indoor air quality, energy consumption, Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) thermal comfort indices).

    Reasoning: The LLM evaluates this data against predefined targets like occupancy comfort, peak demand thresholds, and local carbon grid intensity.

    Control Actions (AI -> EnergyPlus): The LLM calculates optimal Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs) and updates dynamic set-points.

    Forward Injection: The computed set-points and supervisory overrides must automatically feed directly back into the active EnergyPlus instance.

Hackathon Objective
You must build a live, operational Physical AI Proof-of-Concept (PoC) that automates smart building operations through an autonomous closed-loop control pipeline. Using EnergyPlus as the digital building sandbox and an open-source LLM (or an MCP server configuration) as the brain, you will construct a dynamic feedback loop. The AI model must ingest real-time sensor data from the simulation, evaluate variables, and continuously inject forward control actions back into EnergyPlus to prove quantifiable energy and cost savings.

Deliverables
You must submit a GitHub repository (enter the URL in the box provided below) containing the following items:

    Fully Functional Source Code: A unified codebase (Python preferred) managing the EnergyPlus API wrapper, the LLM agent orchestration logic, and the communication bus.

    Building Models (.idf files): The base baseline building file along with the modified versions generated during runtime evaluation.

    Quantitative Savings Dashboard: A visual dashboard or final data export comparing the baseline operation against your AI-driven closed-loop strategy. You must explicitly prove percentage reductions in total kWh consumed while maintaining thermal comfort boundaries.

    System Architecture Document: A short Markdown report explaining your tool-calling architecture, prompt engineering strategies, prompt latency management, and your technical approach to handling lengthy simulation logs.

    PoC Demonstration Video: A maximum 3-minute video recording showing the loop in action—highlighting data transferring live from EnergyPlus to the LLM and the subsequent control actions updating the model parameters automatically.

You must also submit a presentation about your solution. Use this template with relevant slides filled in.
Use the "Upload Files" button below to submit all your deliverables. All files must be in pdf or zip file formats only. In case of errors uploading zip files, convert/print all files to pdf and upload.
